# Flatten array

Multidimensional arrays tend to be REALLY annoying when you're using arrays of arrays.
A multidimensional array can be flattened. Its dimensions are reduced to one. This transformation yields a single-dimensional arrayâ€”one
that is simpler and faster. Generally, people use the formula (x*width+y) to simulate a 2d array in a 1d array.

A 2D array is accessed with a Y and then X position. For rectangular arrays (including all 2D arrays and many jagged arrays) you can
use a single array. You multiply the first coordinate by the width, and then add the second coordinate.

The advantages of using a flat array are improved performance and interoperability with C++ or other languages.
