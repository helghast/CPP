# SOLID
## Single responsibility (SRP), Open-closed (OCP), Liskov substitution (LSP), Interface segregation (ISP) and Dependency inversion (DIP)

In object-oriented computer programming, SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more 
understandable, flexible and maintainable. It is not related to the GRASP software design principles. The principles are a subset of 
many principles promoted by Robert C. Martin. Though they apply to any object-oriented design, the SOLID principles can also form a core 
philosophy for methodologies such as agile development or adaptive software development. The theory of SOLID principles was introduced 
by Martin in his 2000 paper Design Principles and Design Patterns, although the SOLID acronym itself was introduced later by 
Michael Feathers.

## Single responsibility principle
a class should have only a single responsibility
## Open/closed principle
"software entities … should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
## Liskov substitution principle
"objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program."
## Interface segregation principle
"many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."
## Dependency inversion principle[10]
one should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."
